# Project Overview

This project allows users to extract text from SOC 3 PDF documents and answer questions about it using a language model. 

## How It Works
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts all the text from a given PDF document using PyMuPDF.
- **Question Answering**: Uses Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct to generate context-aware answers based on the document content.
